# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-17)

**Core value:** The backend is feature-complete against its own mock-ups and live in production; the differentiator now is proving the whole system — including a real frontend against a real deploy — is reliable.
**Current focus:** v1.3 Phase 8 (Isolated Nonprod Environment, Live and Resettable) — roadmap created, ready to plan

## Current Position

Phase: 8 of 10 (Isolated Nonprod Environment, Live and Resettable)
Plan: — (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-08-18 — v1.3 roadmap created (3 phases, 19/19 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

v1.0–v1.2 velocity/per-plan detail archived at milestone close — see `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`'s Cost Observations per milestone and `.planning/milestones/v1.2-phases/` for individual plan SUMMARY.md files (each carries an `actuals` frontmatter block with tokens/tasks/commits). This section resets per milestone rather than accumulating a project-lifetime table.

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md's Key Decisions table and `.planning/RETROSPECTIVE.md`. The full per-plan decision log for v1.0–v1.2 was cleared at v1.2's close — preserved in `git log` and `.planning/milestones/v1.2-phases/`.

v1.3 decisions so far (from requirements/research, before any phase plan):

- Nonprod colocates on the existing Netcup VPS; a second ~€4/month VPS is the fallback only if live memory measurement (NONPROD-06) says colocation doesn't hold.
- Kafka isolation is a **second Redpanda broker**, not topic-prefixing — the Avro registry's `RecordNameStrategy` keys compatibility history by class name, so prefixed topics would still share the registry.
- The backend does **not** gate its own production promotion on the frontend repo's E2E results; the frontend gates itself on nonprod reachability.
- Phase numbering continues across milestones — v1.3 starts at Phase 8 (v1.2 ended at Phase 7 + inserted 07.1).
- Roadmap compressed research's 4 buildable phases to 3 (granularity `coarse`): RESET-01 folded into Phase 8 rather than standing alone, and the 8 HARDEN-* todos given their own phase (Phase 10) since they are independent of the nonprod build and two of them are not CI at all.

### Pending Todos

Six pending todos are now in-scope v1.3 requirements and should be closed by Phase 10, not re-triaged: dependabot `github-actions` ecosystem (HARDEN-01), TruffleHog live-credential pass (HARDEN-02), digest-pinning (HARDEN-03), gradle cache in `run-tests` (HARDEN-04), gitleaks-in-worktree (HARDEN-05), `security-scan.yml` stale comment/actions (HARDEN-06), cookie `Secure` flag (HARDEN-07), README expansion (HARDEN-08).

Still open and out of v1.3 scope (representative, see `.planning/todos/pending/` for the complete set — ~20 items):

- [security] Audit penetration-testing/security coverage against OWASP API Security Top 10 (CSRF posture, signin rate-limiting, full-depth IDOR, security headers, DTO mass-assignment).
- [minor] Full-system sequence diagram for frontend hand-off; bump Java 21 → 25; enable virtual threads (JDBC/Hibernate pinning risk first).
- [minor] `E2ETest`-suffix vs. `fastTest`-filter coupling decision; two coexisting session-ceiling enforcers; `ActivityAction` enum misplaced in `entity/`.
- [minor] `activity_log` has no retention policy; `TaskMovedEvent` carries no position; `UpdateBoardRequestDTO.name` optionality assumption.
- [minor] OpenAPI breaking-change detection in CI; `POST /signup` `Location` points at a URI with no GET handler; 4 `Location` sites diverge from signup's pattern.
- [minor] Ratchet `dependencyCheckAnalyze`'s `failBuildOnCVSS` after a CPE-matched baseline; evaluate PMD/Checkstyle/SpotBugs; alert-service microservice exploration; JavaDoc verbosity policy; `docs/CODE_STYLE.md` rule 4 claim falsified by 260813-m9x.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **[Phase 8, open unknown]** Nonprod Redpanda's memory floor is genuinely unmeasured. Production's reserved caps leave ~2.65GB unreserved on the 7.8GB host, and `mem_limit` is a per-container cap, not a host reservation — this project already hit a cgroup-accounting surprise at exactly this boundary. Requires iterative live restart cycles; if no safe value fits, the second-VPS fallback must actually be exercised.
- **[Phase 9, known trap]** The existing `deploy-to-netcup` job hardcodes its target directory and the Compose project name is pinned, and `cleanup-old-images` deletes every Docker Hub tag except its own run's. A copy-pasted nonprod job that does not change *every* identity axis will mutate live production, and a shared image repo will let production's next push delete nonprod's running tag.

## Operator Next Steps

- `/gsd-plan-phase 8` to plan the nonprod environment bootstrap. Research flagged Phase 8 as the one needing real iteration budget (Redpanda memory floor); Phases 9 and 10 are standard patterns with existing in-repo precedent.
